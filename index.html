            <h3>Objectives:</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The General Social Survey has three main purposes:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gather data to monitor and explain trends, changes, and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes as well as examine the structure, development, and functioning of society in general as well as the role of various sub-groups.</li>
                <li>Compare the United States to other societies to place American society in comparative perspective and develop cross-national models of human society.</li>
                <li>Make up-to-date, important, high-quality data easily accessible to scholars, students, policy makers, and others with minimal cost and waiting.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Results:</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>GSS results are freely made available to interested parties over the internet, and are widely used in sociological research.
        The data are generally available in formats designed for statistical programs (e.g., R/SAS/SPSS/Stata). 
        The GSS Data Explorer on the General Social Survey website allows any user to download GSS data and search for information
        about GSS questions, variables, and publications, as well as conduct basic analyses directly on the website for free and without
        the need for statistical software.
        The latest available results are those of the 2014 survey.
        The GSS is the most frequently analyzed source of information in the social sciences after the US Census. 
        Information collected in the GSS is used by policy makers, scientific researchers, government officials, and students to better 
        understand Americans, and better meet their changing needs. The GSS is a major teaching tool in colleges and universities: more 
        than 25,000 journal articles, books and other research uses are based on the GSS and over 1,000 have been appearing annually in recent years.
        In addition, about 400,000 students use the GSS in their classes each year. The GSS webpage on the NORC website keeps a current list of the 
        most recent major news reports and media coverage that references GSS data. 
        Some notable facts about the impact of the GSS include the following:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Over 25,000 scholarly publications have used the GSS and over 1,000 have been appearing annually in recent years.</li>
                <li>In the social sciences, only the US Census is used as a data source more frequently than the GSS.</li>
                <li>Each year over 400,000 college students use the GSS in classes. Several innovative programs to teach sociology through hands-on analysis of real data have been developed around the GSS.</li>
                <li>Governmental users of the GSS include the Library of Congress, the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Education, and Justice, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the White House.</li>
                <li>Newspapers, magazines, and broadcast media in North America, Asia, and Europe frequently cite the GSS.</li>
            </ul>
